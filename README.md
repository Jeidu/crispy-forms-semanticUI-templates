# crispy-forms-semanticUI-templates
crispy-forms-semanticUI-templates a set of templates that can be used to get semantic UI
Tested with Semantic-UI 2.1.7

To use it:
copy the semantic-ui folder to your main templates folder in your django app.

Install django-crispy-forms and add extra rules to settings.py:

CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'semantic-ui'

Be warned its a work in progress!!
Any help to complete it is appeciated.

Problems:
- I only fixed form items that I used until now
- Probably a lot more
