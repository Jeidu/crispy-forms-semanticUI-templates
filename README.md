# crispy-forms-semanticUI-templates

crispy-forms-semanticUI-templates a set of templates that can be used to get 
semantic UI formlayouts and error handling in [`django-crispy-forms`](https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms). 

Tested with Semantic-UI 2.1.7.

### Usage

1. Copy the `semantic-ui` folder to your main templates folder in your Django app.

2. Install [`django-crispy-forms`](https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms) and set `semantic-ui` as your `CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK` in your projects' `settings.py`:

```python
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'semantic-ui'
```

Be warned its a work in progress!!
Any help to complete it is appeciated.
